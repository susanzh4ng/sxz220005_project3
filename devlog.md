- After reading through the project details and rewatching the Project 3 Overview, I will get started on the project3.java file.
- I think I am still a bit lost and overwhelmed by the sheer size of our index file.
- The structure of this project is similar to Project 1's because the user enters in commands, so I think I will begin with the "user interface" and set up dummy command actions for this session.
    - I can reference my Project 1's "driver.java" code
